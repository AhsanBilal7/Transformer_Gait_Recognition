# Transformer Gait Recognition
Implemented the Transformer Technology on selective classes for Human Gait Recognition
- I have implemented the Vision Transformer to train on the sequence of the Human Poses
- These Human poses are extracted from the HRNet.
- Initially, this vision transformer is used for image recognition by passing the sequence of patches of images
- I changed the model to learn the sequence of Human Poses that will result in Human Gait Recognition
  
### Instruction
- Please use the embedding layer exactly equal to the  sequence length
- Please make sure to `Query` and `Values`. As these are both required for the Transformer
