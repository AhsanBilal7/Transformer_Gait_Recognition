# Transformer_Gait_Recognition
Implemented the Transformer Technology on selective classes for Human Gait Recognition
- I have implemented the Vision Tranformer to train on the sequence of the Human Poses
- These Human poses are aextracted from the HRNet.
- Initially this vision transformer is used to for image recognition by passing the sequence of patches of images
- I changed the model to learn the sequence of Human Poses that will be result in Human Gait Recognition
  
### Instruction
- Please use the embedding layer exact equal to the  sequence length
- Please make sure to `Query` and `Values`. As these are both required for the Transformer

# Happy Learning !
